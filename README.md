1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.
.foreach goes through each element in an array, and allows you to manipulate data for each of the items inside of the array.
.map creates a new array depending on what you pass into it, for example you can get all the emails from objects without writing a foreach loop.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?
A method is a function inside of an object, they are similar but a function doesn't have to be inside an object.

3. What is closure?
Its how you give access to an outer function's scope from an inner function

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
Window/Global
Any variable that's not inside any function or black is inside the global scope

New
Constructs object based on the function/instance called

Implicit
When a method inside an object is called

Explicit
When you use .apply(), .call(), .bind() or inbuilt functions to manipulate data of an object


5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
Properly access data in the parent class that it is inheriting


## Project Set up

Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:

- [x] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [x] Add TL as collaborator on Github.
- [x] Clone your OWN version of Repo (Not Lambda's by mistake!).
- [x] Create a new Branch on the clone: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [x] Create a pull request before you start working on the project requirements.  You will continuously push your updates throughout the project.
- [x] You are now ready to build this project with your preferred IDE
- [x] Implement the project on your Branch, committing changes regularly.
- [x] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.

Follow these steps for completing your project:

- [x] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's  Repo).
- [ ] Add your team lead as a Reviewer on the Pull-request
- [ ] TL then will count the HW as done by  merging the branch back into master.


## Minimum Viable Product

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

**Pro tip for this challenge: If something seems like it isn't working locally, copy and paste your code up to codepen and take another look at the console.**

## Task 1: Objects and Arrays
Test your knowledge of objects and arrays. 
* [x] Use the [objects-arrays.js](challenges/objects-arrays.js) link to get started.  Read the instructions carefully!

## Task 2: Functions
This challenge takes a look at callbacks and closures as well as scope. 
* [x] Use the [functions.js](challenges/functions.js) link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

## Task 3: Prototypes
Create constructors, bind methods, and create cuboids in this prototypes challenge.
* [x] Use the [prototypes.js](challenges/prototypes.js) link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

## Task 4: Classes
Once you have completed the prototypes challenge, it's time to convert all your hard work into classes.
* [x] Use the [classes.js](challenges/classes.js) link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

In your solutions, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.

## Stretch Problems

There are a few stretch problems found throughout the files, don't work on them until you are finished with MVP requirements!
